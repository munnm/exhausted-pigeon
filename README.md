### Exhausted-pigeon
This is a project I worked on as a Fellow at the Insight Health Data Science Program in Boston. The web app (www.exhaustedpigeon.xyz) 
accesses the Fitbit API to collect a users sleep and activity data, then analyzes the data to provide a personalized user sleep recommendation.
